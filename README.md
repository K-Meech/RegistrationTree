# RegistrationTree

Registration for large images stored in a bdv compatible format e.g. bdv.hdf5

Works for registration of 3D images (2D should also be supported - but has not been tested explicitly!)  
Time series and multichannel images are not supported.

Supports chains of affine transformations (no deformable registrations!)
